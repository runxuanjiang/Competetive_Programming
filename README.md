# Competetive Programming
Personal repository for keeping track of problems, solutions, concepts, and implementations within competetive programming.

## File structure
* `/Implementations` - implementations for data structures and algorithms used in competetive programming.

* `/Solutions` - submissions to problems and contests, organized by contest site/platform. I mainly use Codeforces.

## Websites I use for contests and practice, and my username/handle for each.
