# Competetive Programming
Personal repository for keeping track of problems, solutions, concepts, and implementations within competetive programming.

## File structure
Templated implementations for popular data structures and algorithms are stored in `/Implementations`. The `/notes` directory is used to keep track of concepts previously learned and a to-do list of concepts to learn in the future. It also includes advice and resources for competetive programming in general. The other directories correspond to platforms for competetive programming. I mainly use Codeforces.
