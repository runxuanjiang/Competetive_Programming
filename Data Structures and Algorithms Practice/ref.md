# List of data structures and algorithms to practice implementing:

## Data Structures (all should only use native C types)
* Basic String Library with amortized O(1) insert
* Hash map with hashing function
* Priority queue using heap
* Disjoint Set Union / Union Find
* Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree

## Algorithms
* Common sorting algorithms
* DFS (recursive) and BFS


## Completed (D for Data Structure, A for Algorithm)
