# Codeforces

## File Structure
* `/Competition` - submissions during participation in contests.
* `/Practice` - submissions done oustide of contests for practice.

## File Naming Convention
* Competition:
  * Directory named "<###>D<n>" corresponds to "Codeforces Round #<###> Div. <n>".
  For example, `/663D2` corresponds to my submissions for "Codeforces Round #663 Div. 2".
  * Directory named "Educational<###>" corresponds to "Educational Codeforces Round <###>". For example, `/Educational94` corresponds to "Educational Codeforces Round 94".
  * Any other directory name will correspond to a contest (hosted on Codeforces) with that same name.

* Practice:
  * Files in the `/Completed` directory are accepted submissions, while files outside are still in progress.
  * Files will be named "<####x>.\<problem name\>.cpp, corresponding to problem <###x> in the Codeforces problemset. For example, `4A.Watermelon.cpp` will correspond to problem 4A 'Watermelon'.
  * Sometimes I will practice the same problem multiple times. I will add `_v1`, `_v2`, so on to the problem name to differentiate.
