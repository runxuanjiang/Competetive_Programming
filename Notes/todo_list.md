## Queue of topics to learn
* Binary Search - should probably look at some more examples
* DP across multiple "states"
* Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees
* Articulation Point and Tarjan's algorithm
* Line sweep algorithms - more complex examples (see hackerearth)
* Bitmasking and DP - more complex examples
* Travelling Salesman Problem simplified using bitmask DP
* Extended euclidean algorithm fast
* Factorial and combination algorithms fast
* Rabin Karp and KMP algorithm
